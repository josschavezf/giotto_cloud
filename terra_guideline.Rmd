# Launching Giotto on the Cloud

You can run all your pipelines using Giotto on the Cloud through Terra platform.

## Setting up your Terra account

Go to <https://app.terra.bio/> on Chrome browser and Sign up using your email.


## Creating a billing account

- Create an account on the Google Cloud Platform.
- Set Terra as a billing user on your account.
- Select your Google account to create your billing project on Terra.

## Create a workspace

- Create a workspace within your billing account. Note that all users with access permissions to your workspace will be sharing the same billing account.
- Launch a Virtual Machine with a Cloud environment.


## Create a Cloud Environment

In Terra, you can run Cloud Environments using Jupyter notebooks or the RStudio App. We recommend to your either the Juypyter notebook + Python + Bioconductor or RStudio + Bioconductor options. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01_environments.png")
```

You can customize the memory usage, the number of CPUs, and the persistent disk size for your virtual machine.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/01_vm.png")
```

Once you launched either a Jupyter notebook or the RStudio App, you can install the Giotto package using `remotes::install_github("RubD/Giotto")`.

If your prefer to launch a virtual machine ready to use, you can use our Terra-based Docker image, or the [Giotto's startup script](https://github.com/josschavezf/giotto_cloud/blob/main/startup_script.sh).


## Customizing your Cloud Environment using a Giotto's Docker image

Under Application configuration, use the option Custom Environment and introduce the link to Docker container, named josschavezf/terra-jupyter-bioconductor-giotto:latest

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/02_docker.png")
```

## Customizing your Cloud Environment using a Startup Script

You can download the Startup Script from this [link](https://github.com/josschavezf/giotto_cloud/blob/main/startup_script.sh)

- Upload the Startup Script to your Terra Cloud documents.



- Click on the startup_script.sh document and select "See ... " this option will re-direct you to your Google cloud documents page



- Click on the startup_script.sh document to display the file details. Copy the link


- Use this link to launch the Cloud environment under the Startup Script option



- Click on Create Environment




## Share your workspace with collaborators


```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/04_share.png")
```
